# Movies-ETL

The purpose of this module was to introduce us to the extract, transform, load (ETL) process. To do so, we were given a scenario in which we had to take extract a large amount of data, transform the data, and finally load it into a human-readable form. In order to achieve this, we learned how to perform the following tasks:
- create an ETL pipeline from raw data into an SQL database.
- use python to extract data from different sources
- clean the data using pandas
- transform the data using pandas
- parse data using regular expressions
- transform text into numbers using regular expressions
- load data with PostgreSQL
